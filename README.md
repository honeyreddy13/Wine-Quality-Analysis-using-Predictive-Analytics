Using Supervised Algorithms to predict the wine quality
### Wine Quality Analysis Project  
**Objective:** Conducted a comprehensive analysis of wine quality using supervised machine learning algorithms to identify the most accurate model for prediction.  

**Key Contributions:**  
- **Data Handling:** Preprocessed and explored the wine dataset to ensure clean and structured data for model building.  
- **Modeling:** Implemented and compared multiple algorithms, including Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, to predict wine quality.  
- **Evaluation:** Assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and error rate for effective comparison.  
- **Documentation and Presentation:** Prepared a detailed 30-page report, an engaging presentation, and a LinkedIn video summarizing the project's findings.  

**Technology Used:**  
- **Tools:** R programming  
- **Purpose:** To evaluate and compare predictive models for wine quality, providing insights into the best-performing algorithm for accurate predictions.  

**Outcome:** Successfully identified the most reliable algorithm for wine quality prediction, enhancing decision-making capabilities in quality assessment.
